# DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng

Welcome to the **DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng** repository! This repository contains all my coursework, assignments, and projects completed during the Deep Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

## Overview

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand deep learning, its applications, and build neural network models. The specialization consists of five courses:

### [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/DeepLearning.AI-Deep-Learning-Specialization-By-Andrew-Ng/tree/main/Course%201%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)

This course provides an introduction to neural networks and deep learning. You will learn about:
- The foundations of deep learning.
- The key parameters in a neural network's architecture.
- How to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset.
- How to implement a neural network using Python and NumPy.

### [Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization](https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/DeepLearning.AI-Deep-Learning-Specialization-By-Andrew-Ng/tree/main/Course%202%20-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%3A%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)

In this course, you will delve deeper into the mechanics of deep learning and learn techniques to improve your models. Topics include:
- Practical aspects of deep learning.
- Setting up your machine learning project with proper train/dev/test sets.
- Hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and dropout regularization.
- Implementing optimization algorithms such as mini-batch gradient descent, RMSprop, and Adam.

### [Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/DeepLearning.AI-Deep-Learning-Specialization-By-Andrew-Ng/tree/main/Course%203%20-%20Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects)

This course focuses on how to build a successful machine learning project. You will learn:
- How to structure machine learning projects.
- Strategies for reducing error in machine learning systems.
- The importance of orthogonalization.
- Establishing a baseline level of performance and setting up a productive machine learning environment.

### [Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/DeepLearning.AI-Deep-Learning-Specialization-By-Andrew-Ng/tree/main/Course%204%20-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)

This course covers convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications. Topics include:
- The basics of CNNs and how they work.
- Building and training CNNs for image recognition and computer vision tasks.
- Advanced architectures such as ResNets, Inception networks, and more.
- Practical applications of CNNs including object detection and neural style transfer.

### [Course 5: Sequence Models](https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/DeepLearning.AI-Deep-Learning-Specialization-By-Andrew-Ng/tree/main/Course%205%20-%20Sequence%20Models)

In this course, you will explore sequence models and their applications. You will learn about:
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRUs).
- How to apply sequence models to natural language processing and other tasks involving sequential data.
- Building and training sequence models for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.
- Attention mechanisms and how they enhance the performance of sequence models.
